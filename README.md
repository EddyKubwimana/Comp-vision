OpenCV in Python provides a wide range of functionalities and utilities for image and video processing. In this repostitory, I tried to learn about some functionalities such as :

Image Input/Output: OpenCV provides functions to read and write images in various formats such as BMP, JPG, PNG, and TIFF.

Image Manipulation: OpenCV provides functions to perform basic image manipulation operations such as cropping, resizing, and rotation.

Image Processing: OpenCV provides functions to perform image processing operations such as thresholding, edge detection, and color space conversion.

Object Detection: OpenCV provides functions to perform object detection using techniques such as Haar cascades, HOG, and YOLO.

Feature Detection and Description: OpenCV provides functions to detect and describe features in an image such as SIFT, SURF, and ORB.

Video Input/Output: OpenCV provides functions to read and write video files in various formats such as AVI, MP4, and MKV.
